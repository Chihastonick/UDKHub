## About

A mirror of useful projects hosted on UDN. Note that, except in special cases, this is a __source__ mirror only (in other words, no assets provided). To download relevant assets, follow the links to the original pages below. I'm only keeping these here for reference and as a backup; I don't see why they would be of use to anyone without assets...

## Packages

- __PhysXMod__: allows users to add [PhysX particles](http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/DevelopmentKitGemsPhysXParticlesStarterKit.html) to their game _a la_ Arkham City, which makes the game look a whole lot cooler
- __StarterPlatformGame__: turns UDK into a [sidescroller platformer](http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/DevelopmentKitGemsPlatformerStarterKit.html), which is insanely useful for a whole lot of projects
- __UDKMOBA__: allows users to develop a [multiplayer online battle game](http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/MOBAKit.html) much in the style of League of Legends
