## About

A source mirror of the 2012 winner of the human-like game bot competition, which uses Unreal Tournament 2004 for testing. However, it is reasonable to assume that the sources herein are also useful for UDK AI development. More information and a link to download of the full package can be found [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?ut2).
